The objective of this assignment is to implement algorithms 5 and 6 from chapter 10. Down-
load the sample code for this chapter from the book website and note the
addition of two blocks labeled PathManager and PathFollower. The Chapter 10 output of the path manager is
y manager = [flag , Va_d , r , q, c , ρ , λ]

where flag=1 indicates that P_line(r, q) should be followed and flag=2
indicates that P_orbit(c, ρ, λ) should be followed, and where Va_d is the desired
airspeed.

10.1 Modify path follow.m to implement algorithms 5 and 6. By
modifying path manager chap10.m test both the straight-line
and orbit-following algorithms on the guidance model given in equa-
tion (9.18). An example Simulink diagram is given
mavsim chap10 model.mdl. Test your design with significant
constant winds (e.g., w_n = 3, w_e = −3). Tune the gains to get
acceptable performance.
Hint: The simulated model of GPS discussed in section 7.5 contains
an unobservable bias. This bias will show up in the simulations. To
evaluate and debug your path-following algorithm, you may want to
turn off the Gauss-Markov bias generator.

10.2 Implement the path following algorithms on the full six-DOF simula-
tion of the MAV. Test your design with significant constant
winds (e.g., w_n = 3, w_e = −3). If necessary, tune the gains to get
acceptable performance.
