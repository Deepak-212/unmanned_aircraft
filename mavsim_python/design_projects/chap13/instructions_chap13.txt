13.1 Implement the gimbal pointing algorithm described in section 13.2.
Download the files from the website that are associated with this
chapter. Modify param.m so that the buildings have a maximum
height of one meter, and modify the path planner so that the MAV
moves between two fixed locations. Use the Simulink model
mavsim chap13 gimbal.mdl and modify the file
point gimbal.m to implement the gimbal pointing algorithm given
by equations (13.13) and (13.14).

13.2 Implement the geolocation algorithms described in section 13.3. Use
the gimbal-pointing routine developed in the previous problem to point
the gimbal at the target. Use the Simulink model
mavsim chap13 geolocation.mdl and modify the file
geolocation.m to implement the geolocation algorithm described
in section 13.3.
